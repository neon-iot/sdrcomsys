# Communication Systems Based on Software Defined Radio
## About this course
The main motivation of the course is to train professionals and students in the handling of Software Defined Radio (SDR) devices. 

The course is focussed on SDR not only from the programming point of view, but also from the complementary hardware for its operation. Which can include filters, low noise amplifiers, power amplifiers, splitters, antennas, and impedance matches. The idea is that the course is complemented with others offered by our University. In this way, the SDR devices and complementary hardware can be used in the course hands on IoT, while the design details of the hardware can be developed in the course of microwave design.
I consider important that the complementary hardware can be studied due to it is very useful not only to optimize the performance of the communication system, but also to avoid damaging the SDR devices.
The main tool for simulation and programming will be the GNU Radio Companion. This open source tool has a large number of libraries and drivers. But in addition, it allows to implement new libraries in an agile way according to the user's needs.

Throughout the course, attendees will learn by solving problems, whether from the academic field (such as degree or PhD thesis), as well as from the business field.

## Main topics
The structure of the course is  :
- Introduction to the course. 
    - Review of digital signal processing. 
    - Review of Communications Systems
- GNURadio Environment. 
    - Presentation. 
    - Installation. 
    - Mode of use. 
    - Programming of basic systems in GNU Radio (Spectrum analyzer, AM, FM, QAM, FSK, PSK)
- SDR Devices: 
    - Use, configuration, precautions. 
    - Complementary hardware.
    - Remote Access.
- Digital communications systems.
- Communications systems in the presence of noise.
- Advanced communications systems: case studies: AIS, ADS-B, ACARS.
- Final project.


## What you will learn
The objective of the course is that the student is trained in the design and implementation of SDR communications systems. The main idea is that the student is able to evaluate, design and implement an SDR system that not only includes the development of software, firmware, but also its RF hardware.

## What you will need:
To take this course you need to have knowledge of the following topics:
- Communications systems.
- Digital signal processing.
- Analysis and Synthesis of electronic circuits (filters, amplifiers, among others).

The main tools of the course are:
- GNU Radio Companion.
- Python.
Also, the course will be based on the following SDRs:
- ADALM PLUTO SDR
-RTL2832U

The SDR devices will be available in practical classes and for remote access.
